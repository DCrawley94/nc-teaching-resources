# Reversed

The `Reversed` class should create on iterable object when instantiated with a collection.

When iterated through the iterable should return the elements of the given collection in reverse order.

As an iterable should be able to create an iterator we will be creating two classes:

`Reversed`: The `iterable` class that will be responsible for implementing the iterable protocol
`ReversedIterator`: The `iterator` class that will be responsible for implementing the iterator protocol
