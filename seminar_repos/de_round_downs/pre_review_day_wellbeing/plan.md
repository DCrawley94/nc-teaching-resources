# Imposter Syndrome session

## Intro

Poll - who has heard of imposter syndrome

Question - Can anyone tell me what it is?

## Types of Imposter Syndrome

Discuss

> The Perfectionist is someone who always looks for things to go perfectly - if they encounter small errors they feel as though they have failed, leading to undeserved shame and guilt.

> The Expert seeks to know everything about everything. If they feel as though someone else knows more than them, they will feel like a failure.

> For the Superhero, success is based on how many things they can do - parent, partner, boss etc - if they can’t succeed in each role, they may feel like a fraud.

> The Natural expects to be able to do something correctly the first time, they are often reluctant to do something again and can therefore get upset when they aren’t ‘naturally’ amazing at something.

> The Soloist wants to do everything alone - they feel as though if they can’t do it alone, then they can’t do it.

## How can we help each other?

- Remind each other that we don’t have to finish the sprints (this is about practise)

- You passed the entry challenge and the precourse

- show our own insecurities / empathise / commiserate about what you also struggle with

- it’s encouraged to make mistakes - you’ll learn more

- discuss what you need (i need to stop and ask questions)

- discuss code out loud and go over code you have written as a pair

- change the way you’re explaining it

- if you’re feeling imposter syndrome, say it (either out loud, to us or someone else you trust)

- celebrate each others’ successes

- remind yourself that you’re learning to be a jnr developer

- it’s ok to say that you’re struggling

- have patience

- check in with each other

- conversations

- remind each other that you don’t have to finish the sprints, understanding your code is much more important than rushing through your code. Make sure you’re talking through with other people.

- Give compliments to other people - ‘really impressive coding there!’ (you don’t have to put yourself down doing it!!!!)
