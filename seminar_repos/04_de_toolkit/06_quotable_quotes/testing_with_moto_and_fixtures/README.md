# Testing with Moto (with special guest Pytest Fixtures)

I'd recommend with having the code pre-written before writing tests like the ones in `test_example_start`.

Once that's done you can work on a refactor with fixtures like the tests in `test_example_end`.

You can use this a good opportunity to discuss the merits of extracting the 'Arrange` part of 'Arrange/Act/Assert' such as:

- readability
- reusability

etc.
