We need to build a `http` server.

The server should have an endpoint, `/api/artworks`, that will respond to GET requests with the JSON data stored in the `artworks.json` file.

Once that endpoint is created we will discuss how we could approach the following endpoint: `/api/artworks/:artworkId`. This endpoint should respond with the artwork data that has the given ID number.
