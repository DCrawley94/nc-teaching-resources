# Pytest Refresher and AAA

## Learning Objectives

- Know how to set up a python virtual environment, ready for testing.
- Understand the steps of TDD (red-green-refactor)
- Use Arrange, Act, Assert pattern

## Intro

Introduce the repo and explain that we're gonna be working through a kata with TDD.

Show the repo structure: src/test

Nothing installed in the project so will be setting that up from scratch.

Ask students to guide me through the initial set up steps:

- create virtual environment
- start virtual environment
- install pytest to virtual environment
- set up PYTHONPATH? - only do this if students ask for it, can be left until I start running tests
