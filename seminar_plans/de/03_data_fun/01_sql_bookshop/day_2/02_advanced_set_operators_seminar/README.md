# Bear Crimes & Bad Cats

The Animal Crimes division of the FBI (Furry Bureau of Investigation) have asked
us to help investigate some dangerous criminal masterminds. In order to find
these fluffy menaces we will need to find the following -

## 1

- A list of all bears with their crimes.
- A list of all cats with their crimes

## 2

- A list of all unique crimes
- A list of all bear only crimes
- A list of all cat only crimes
- A list of crimes that are listed for both species

## 3

- Use conditional expressions to list all of the bears according to
  `danger_rating` as one of three descriptions: <br> 9 or above = "very
  dangerous" <br> 7 or 8 = "dangerous" <br> 6 or below "not dangerous"

- Now list them in order of dangerousness

## 4

If there's time use aggregate functions to get -

- The average Danger Rating across all bears.
- How many guilty parties there are in each crime category.
