# Thursday Code discussion

Start by looking at the first debugging problem - but focus on imports

## Focusing on reading and understanding error messages

- Task 1/2 - expected value is not the received one

- Task 3 NameError - what does this mean?

- Task 4 AttributeError - What does this mean?

- Task 5 TypeError - What does this mean?

- Extension 1 - Good for breaking down bugs in sequence and getting to a working solution

- Work through rest of the extensions - focus on the test output etc.

## Ext 2:

- return bank account
- interest rate calculation: should be `+= (bank_account * interest_rate)`
- use `round(bank_account, 2)` to round to 2 d.p

## Ext 3:

- get students to identify what has happened based on the assert output
