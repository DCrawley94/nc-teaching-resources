Things to cover:

- End of week 1 vibe check
- Seminars over the rest of the course - some will be just this group, some will be mixed with the other seminar group. You will find out more about this in time but I can tell you that you will have a seminar from me on Monday and Tuesday and then I will be on Annula Leave for a week and a half so you will see others.
- What will the rest of the course looks like?
  - Daily lectures and regular seminar
  - Accompanying sprints, sometime they cover a single day sometime 2
- How do I get for help?

  - Daily check ins from mentors - these are our priority to make sure everyone is seen, opportunity for us to see how youâ€™re doing and for you to ask questions - please make sure you are available during the course hours of 9-5 so we can do this!
  - Helpdesk available though you may have to wait at Times

- Attendance
  - This week has been a bit more relaxed and a lot of you have finished the work however from next week you will likely find that there is too much work to complete. Do not worry about completing everything!
