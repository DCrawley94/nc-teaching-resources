# How Can Kids Learn To Code?

This talk was initially titled "When Can Kids Learn To Code" but that was before I actually planned the talk.

What's the topic:

- I'm going to talk about the skills that children can learn that are relevant to programming, and also why they should learn them
- For the purpose of this talk I'll be more focussed on children aged 0-11
- **However** that's not to say the things I'll be talking about are not relevant to older children as well!

## Intro

Who I am / What I do:

- seminar lead
- teach Data Engineering

Why I'm talking about it:

- I used to work in the Early Years sector and this stuff interests me
- Education is important, especially at young ages
- Children have brains like sponges - there's no better time to learn

## What are children able to learn?

- logical thinking
- problem solving
- creativity
- perseverance

## Why should kids learn these skills?

- Life skills
- Promotes digital literacy
- Young children are able to learn computational thinking concepts and skills
- Well equipped for the future
- **Not** to become developers

## Brain Development overview

### How children learn

Early Years:

- Exploratory play
- Positive adult interactions/observations (for example if they see someone on the phone they might pick up a toy phone and babble)

Preschool/Reception:

- At age 4/5 children should start to build an understanding of rudimentary mathematics (spatial reasoning, comparisons, repeating patterns), among other things and be engaging in creative play.
- If your child is regularly attending a nursery then they should have targeted activities to facilitate this development but you can do this at home as well.

Primary:

- More structured learning according to the curriculum

### Computational Thinking

What is computational thinking?

- A way of thinking to solve problems
- Allows you to take a complex problem, analyse it, break it down and develop possible solutions
- Not specific to a subject, it's a fundamental skill
- Important for life in general, not just for programmers

Logical reasoning:

- logical reasoning is the process by which we make sense of and understand why things happen
- children often do this instinctually - for example watching an adult use a phone, a child might then begin to experiment and quickly build a mental model of how it works (swiping/tapping at the screen)
- In computing terms this could be seen ad connecting input to output and using knowledge of a system to predict how it will behave or often why it is not behaving.

Decomposition:

- Decomposition is the act of breaking a given problem down into a series of small, manageable steps.
- An example could be baking a cake:
  - knowing that the egg needs to be broken first.
- Young children can engage in activities like baking
- Older children can learn this skill while doing things like tying shoes
- Also primary age children might do things like writing a story in english lessons - a teacher would encourage breaking it into parts like beginning/middle/end

Pattern Recognition: - Looking for similarities and differences

- While younger children can start to recognise patterns towards the age of 5 it will come into play a bit more as they get older.
- A problem, once broken down, can make it easier to spot similarities and patterns
- Similar problem solving steps can be generalised
- Also patters can quickly lead to rules - e.g. angles in a triangle always adding up to 180
- being able to recognise patterns leads to quicker problem solving

## Relevant Stuff:

- Bee Bot - programming a path for a robot to follow
- Scratch/Scratch Junior
- Hedy - older kids can learn a subset of syntactically valid Python
- Even older - can start to learn a bit with free online course if they're interest

## Supporting Kids learning

- make it entertaining and relevant to their interests
- variety is good
- don't be afraid to switch tracks
- multiple shorted sessions are better than 1 long one
- spacing is good
- see if they're able to recall things
- No one size fits all approach, you know your child best

- Exercise patience with them
- encourage them to try new things and make mistakes - resilience and perseverance is important
- learn together and show interest in what they're doing
